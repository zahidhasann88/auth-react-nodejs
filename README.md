# Token-Based Authentication (JWT) with Node, React, TypeScript

This project implements Token-Based Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with a stack comprising Node.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Overview

Token-Based Authentication is a secure method for authenticating users by issuing a digitally signed token. This project demonstrates the implementation of JWT-based authentication using Node.js on the backend and React with TypeScript on the frontend.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Node.js Backend**: Provides the server-side implementation for user authentication.
- **React Frontend**: Utilizes TypeScript for building client-side authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment for JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to build the RESTful API.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for creating secure tokens for authentication.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript providing static typing for robustness.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords securely.
- **axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests from React.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Installation**: Install dependencies in both the Node.js backend and React frontend using `npm install`.
3. **Configuration**:
   - Set up environment variables for sensitive data like secret keys.
   - Configure database connections if applicable.
4. **Usage**:
   - Start the Node.js backend server using `npm start`.
   - Run the React frontend with `npm start` and access it in your browser.
   
## Implementation Details

The Node.js backend provides routes and controllers for user authentication, token generation, and validation. It integrates JWT for creating and verifying tokens.
